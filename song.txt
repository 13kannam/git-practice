I wish love was perfect as love itself
I wish all my weaknesses could be hidden
I grew a flower that can’t be bloomed in a dream that can’t come true

Woo, I dont know, I dont know, I dont know why
Woo, even I, even I don’t know myself
Woo, I just know, I just know, I just know why
'Cause it’s all fake love, fake love, fake love
